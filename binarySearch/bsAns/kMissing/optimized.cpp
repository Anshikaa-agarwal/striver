// Problem Statement: You are given a strictly increasing array ‘vec’ and a positive integer 'k'. Find the 'kth' positive integer missing from 'vec'.

/*
Example 1:  vec[]={4,7,9,10}, k = 1, result = 1
            explanation:  The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, ……, and so on. Since 'k' is 1, the first missing element is 1.

Example 2:  vec[]={4,7,9,10}, k = 4, result = 5
            explanation: The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, ……, and so on. Since 'k' is 4, the fourth missing element is 5.
